# Vite Plugins

Cossack includes a security plugin named `vite-security-plugin`. It removes server code from client bundles.

## Client-only modules

Files named `*.client.ts` or `*.client.mts` are browser-only modules. The client
environment receives their source unchanged, including top-level browser
initialization. SSR environments receive generated placeholders for their
named and default runtime exports instead, which prevents top-level `window`,
`document`, and browser-library code from executing on the server.

Static imports from shared component files are supported. Importing a
client-only export during SSR does not throw, but reading or invoking it does,
with guidance to move the access into `onMount()`, `clientInit()`, or an
`@Client()` method. Never access these exports from SSR paths such as
`render()`, `init()`, or server-side field initializers.

Use explicit exports in client-only modules. Type-only exports are ignored,
while runtime `export *` is rejected because the plugin cannot safely derive a
local placeholder interface for it.
