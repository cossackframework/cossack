# Draft 0.9.0 migration guide

This is a working record of verified behavior changes. It is not yet a complete
release migration guide. REL-04 must audit the full release checklist, add every
remaining break, compile its examples, and verify package installation before
publishing 0.9.0. Package versions remain 0.8.3 while that work is open.

## Ordinary RPC results no longer appear as generator yields

Ordinary HTTP/SSE component calls previously yielded their JSON return value
once. WebSocket and explicit service calls returned it only at completion.
All transports now keep ordinary results in completion, matching
`RpcCall<Result, never>`. Async generator actions still yield their incremental
values and return their final result separately.

Replace a loop that consumes an ordinary method's single result:

```typescript
// Before: depended on HTTP/SSE's extra yield.
for await (const result of this.save(input)) {
  this.savedId = result.id;
}

// After: completion works across transports.
const result = await this.save(input);
this.savedId = result.id;
```

If the action is a generator, keep one call and iterate then await it:

```typescript
const call = rpc$(this.generate(3));
for await (const progress of call) {
  this.progress = progress.step;
}
const result = await call;
this.total = result.total;
```

Import `rpc$` from `@cossackframework/core` and use it in a client handler.
The helper infers the authored generator's yield and terminal types; it returns
the existing proxy operation by identity. It is not a wrapper for native server
execution. See [the complete client contract](../docs/rpc.md) for cancellation,
duplicate consumers, broad iterable annotations, and native Response types.

## Streaming writes now reject after headers finalize

Late cookie, flash, and `c.header` writes previously appeared to succeed even
though the browser could not receive them. They now throw
`COSSACK_RESPONSE_HEADERS_COMMITTED`. Session `bindUser()` and `destroy()` also
reject before changing storage. Move these writes into an ordinary async server
method before returning a generator. Generator bodies execute lazily after
middleware finishes, including statements before the first yield. Session bag
writes that do not change cookies retain their storage behavior.

## Native responses require HTTP/SSE actions

WebSocket actions returning native `Response` objects now fail with
`COSSACK_RPC_HTTP_RESPONSE_REQUIRED`, instead of silently returning `{}`.
Return serializable data or use an HTTP/SSE action for HTTP response behavior.
Nested `Response`, `Request`, and `Headers` objects in serialized RPC values
now produce a path-specific `COSSACK_RPC_SERIALIZATION_FAILED` error.

Native HTTP/SSE RPC redirects become client navigation metadata. Response cookies
are preserved alongside helper and flash cookies. Valid flash survives background
transport requests until the next page; RPC HTTP failures discard partial outgoing
flash. Stream errors after headers finalize cannot retract previously sent cookies.
See [RPC examples and timing](../docs/rpc.md).

## Service RPC keeps internal exceptions private in development

Service actions previously returned internal exception messages and stacks to
clients when development mode was active. They now return `Internal Server Error`
with `COSSACK_RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR` and the request ID, matching component and
WebSocket calls. Inspect server logs for the original exception. Use
`ClientVisibleError` for a deliberate message or action validation for field
errors that callers should receive.

## Client RPC types now describe JSON values

`rpc$`, `RpcResult`, and `RpcYield` now use `RpcSerialized<T>` for returned and
yielded data. A Date becomes a string, array entries containing undefined become
null, undefined object fields disappear, model prototype methods disappear, and
typed `toJSON()` output replaces the native class shape. The compiler's recognized
return annotations delegate to these same core types.

Replace native Date use in client completions with explicit parsing:

```typescript
const result = await rpc$(this.loadRecord());
const createdAt = new Date(result.createdAt);
```

Non-finite numbers, invalid Dates, binary and opaque native values now reject
instead of silently becoming null, empty objects, or numeric-keyed records.
Custom JSON output is evaluated once and validated before encoding. WebSocket
File/Blob arguments reject before dispatch; they are no longer silently removed.
HTTP component file uploads retain their separate multipart path. Ordinary
multipart result serialization and private-error redaction match JSON RPC.
Root result JSON hooks receive the empty key consistently across transports.

## Native HTTP RPC responses have an explicit client result

Successful ordinary HTTP/SSE component and service actions returning `Response`
now resolve to a local buffered browser `Response`, instead of parsing the body
as framework state. Text, JSON, binary and 204 responses work. Component uploads
preserve binary bodies and browser-visible headers. Use `response.text()`,
`json()`, `blob()` or `arrayBuffer()` after checking for undefined: native redirects
navigate and complete with undefined. `RpcResult` now infers `Response | undefined`.
Non-success HTTP statuses still reject with status/request-ID diagnostics.

Native bodies are consumed before the RPC completes, with a 1 MiB limit,
`COSSACK_RPC_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE`, cancellation, deadlines and request cleanup.
The local response has no original fetch URL or redirect flag. Repeated awaits
share the same one-use body; clone it before multiple reads. Native response
bodies never hydrate component/service state. Prefer typed data returns for
state synchronization or use an HTTP endpoint for large or continuous bodies.
Generator Response values remain unsupported; their inferred terminal result
is now never rather than unknown. WebSocket rejection cancels the native body.

## Multipart actions use the shared RPC pipeline

File arguments in HTTP/SSE component or explicit scoped service calls now use
the same action dispatcher as JSON. Nested references are restored before input
validation; layout services, request/ORM context, generator replies, cookies,
redirects and cleanup follow the existing RPC contract. Duplicate metadata/file
parts, missing or malformed markers, invalid JSON and envelope shapes reject
with `COSSACK_RPC_REQUEST_INVALID` before actions run. `_cossack_file_id` is a
reserved multipart payload field. Malformed JSON RPC envelopes use the same code.

Component uploads use Fetch unless a numeric `<method>Progress` field requests
XHR progress events. Prefer `@ClientState` for that field. XHR generator replies
are decoded progressively at complete lines; native binary replies still use
arraybuffer. XHR retains downloaded text and cannot apply download backpressure;
use the default Fetch path for long streams. Service uploads use Fetch. Files and
FileList/arrays are arguments only, not JSON state or returned values.

Cancellation between yields now preserves a known request ID on component,
service and WebSocket calls, including iterator return. IDs can still be unknown
before HTTP headers arrive. Cancellation never implies mutation rollback or
automatic retry.
